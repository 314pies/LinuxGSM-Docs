# Getting Started
The best way to get started is to visit [LinuxGSM.com](http://linuxgsm.com/servers) and pick a server you want to install. Follow the simple step-by-step guide to install your game server on Linux.

Remember you may also need to configure your firewall to open the relevent ports to allow people access to your game server once started.
