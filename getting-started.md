# Getting Started

The best way to get started is to visit [LinuxGSM.com](http://linuxgsm.com/servers) and pick a server to install. Follow the simple step-by-step guide to install your game server on Linux.

Once the instalation is complete a working game server will be available. Use the various LinuxGSM commands available to manage the game server.

Ensure that the game server ports are open to allow players can join.
