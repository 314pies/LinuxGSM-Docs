# Summary
Most servers require a specific version of Glibc installed. Newer distros normally have the required version. However the older the distro the less likely the server will run. Check the requirements below. If you have an older distro the game server may still run with a [Glibc fix](#glibc-fixes).

Glibc fixes
===========

> Many of the servers can work on distros with older _Glibc_ versions by using the _Glibc_ fixes that are available with LGSM. 

This simply copies the required files to the `serverfiles` directory. Many game servers will look for there dependencies in there `serverfiles` directory. Even if your dedicated server does not meet the Glibc requirement the server may still work.

These fixes prevent errors similar to the following:
```
version `GLIBC_2.15â€² not found
```   
```
./7DaysToDie.x86: /usr/lib/libstdc++.so.6: version GLIBCXX_3.4.15 not found (required by ./7DaysToDie.x86)
./7DaysToDie.x86: /lib/libc.so.6: version GLIBC_2.15 not found (required by ./7DaysToDie.x86)
./7DaysToDie.x86: /lib/libm.so.6: version GLIBC_2.15 not found (required by ./7DaysToDie.x86)
```
