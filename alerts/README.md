# Alerts

LinuxGSM allows you to receive various alerts should the game server require your attention. Should the server crash you will be notified of the failure allowing you to take action.

## More Info

More info allows you to get further info about an alert using hastebin.com. Many alerts only give basic info, unlike email. More info displays the same output as email in a link within a basic alert.

## Display IP

The IP address you want to be displayed in alerts. By default, the LinuxGSM alert will display the external internet facing IP. Failing this will fall back to the server IP. If the IP is incorrect it can be manually set using `displayip=""`.
