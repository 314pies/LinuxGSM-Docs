The `update-functions` command allows you to get the latest functions released to the Github's master branch.

The "gameserver" script that you download in order to use LGSM is actually a tool to download other LGSM script files located in lgsm/functions, where all the actual work is done.

## Commands

`./gameserver update-functions`
`./gameserver uf`

## Good to know

### Too old "gameserver" scripts

Even if we're avoiding it as much as possible, sometimes, we need to alter main scripts ("gameserver") in order to add new functionalities or fix bugs. It might occur that you need to re-download and re-configure your "gameserver" script in order to enjoy the full potential of LGSM or solve issues. It usually happens when your main script gets very old or if a major update just happened.
