* New branches are created from "develop" branch, except for hotfixes that comes from "master"
* They can be either "features" "releases" "hotfix" or a branch that has the name of the dev
* They all merge into "develop"
* For release, a temp release branch is created to be merged, then into master by Daniel Gibbs.
* Commands and flags are not an issue for us, since Daniel takes care of it upon release, as well as version numbering.
