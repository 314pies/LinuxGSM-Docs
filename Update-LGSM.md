The `update-lgsm` command allows you to get the latest functions released to the Github's master branch.

The `./gameserver` script that you download in order to use LinuxGSM is actually a tool to download other LinuxGSM script files located in `lgsm/functions`, where all the actual work is done.

## Commands

Standard: `./gameserver update-lgsm`

Short: `./gameserver ul`

## Good to know

### Too old "gameserver" scripts

Even if we're avoiding it as much as possible, sometimes, we need to alter main scripts (`./gameserver`) in order to add new functionality or fix bugs. It might occur that you need to re-download and re-configure your `./gameserver` script in order to enjoy the full potential of LinuxGSM or solve issues. It usually happens when your main script gets very old or if a major update just happened. The developers will always try to make functions backwards compatible as much as possible.
