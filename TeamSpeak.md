## TeamSpeak's Database and MariaDB

TeamSpeak's database contains all user information, groups, and statistics from your server. 
By default, TeamSpeak uses an SQLIte database file, which allows good enough performance for most users, and easy server transfers from a machine to another.

However, you have the possibility to use MariaDB which is an alternative to MySQL to handle the database.
MariaDB is totally optionnal.
So during the install process, unless you need it, don't focus too hard on it, just discard the MariaDB message.
