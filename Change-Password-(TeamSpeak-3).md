Your query password is set and given to you upon the server installation. You will also be able to find the password in the logs. However, if you do lose that password or wish to change it, we made a command to make it smoother.

# Commands

Standard: `./gameserver change-password`

Short: `./gameserver pw`

Your server will reboot and generate a new password.
