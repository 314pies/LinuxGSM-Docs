# What is Steam Guard?
Steam Guard is an additional level of security that can be applied to your Steam account. The first level of security on your account is your login credentials: your Steam account name and password. With Steam Guard, a second level of security is applied to your account, making it harder for your Steam account to fall into the wrong hands.

When Steam Guard is enabled on your account, when you login to your Steam account from an unrecognized device you'll need to provide a special access code to verify it's your account. Depending on your Steam Guard settings, you'll either receive an email with the special code or you'll get it from the Steam Mobile app on your smartphone.

# Authentication Methods for SteamCMD

1. Username and Password - No Steam Guard
2. Username and Password - Steam Guard via Email (recommended)
3. Username and Password - Steam Guard via Smartphone (not compatible with LGSM)

# Using Steam Guard with LGSM

Both options 1 & 2 work with LGSM. You can either have Steam Guard disabled or have Steam Guard via email.

Steam Guard via Smartphone is not compatible because it requires a code every time you login to SteamCMD. This is problematic if you want your servers to auto update.
