LGSM uses tmux to run servers in the background so the instance is not lost when you close a terminal session.

Tmux is a key component of LGSM and replaced [screen] which was used on early versions of LGSM. tmux has a few improvements over screen; mainly being better at handling of non root users which was a major issue when developing LGSM with screen. tmux allows LGSM to call up a game server running an the background so you can see what it is doing; this feature is available with console feature of LGSM.

LGSM requires _tmux =\> 1.6_ to enable console logging.

Known Issues
------------

Tmux 1.8
========
tmux 1.8 has an issue that prevents console logging from working. This is because the `pipe-pane` feature is broken in tmux 1.8 causing is not to output the console to the console log files. The only solution is to use another version of tmux.

create session failed: Operation not permitted
==============================================
This issue occurs on CentOS mainly. This is caused by the standard user not having permissions to user _/dev/ptmx_.
```
create session failed: ./srcds_linux -game csgo: Operation not permitted
```

To fix this the user needs to be part of the _tty_ group.

```
usermod -G tty csgoserver
```
To check the user has been added check _/etc/group_.
```
grep tty /etc/group
```
```
tty:x:5:csgoserver
```
