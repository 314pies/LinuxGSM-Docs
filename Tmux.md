LGSM uses tmux to run servers in the background so the instance is not lost when you close a terminal session.

Tmux is a key component of LGSM and replaced [screen] which was used on early versions of LGSM. tmux has a few improvements over screen; mainly being better at handling of non root users which was a major issue when developing LGSM with screen. tmux allows LGSM to call up a game server running an the background so you can see what it is doing; this feature is available with console feature of LGSM.

LGSM requires _tmux =\> 1.6_ to enable console logging.

Known Issues
------------

Tmux 1.8
========
tmux 1.8 has an issue that prevents console logging from working. This is because the `pipe-pane` feature is broken in tmux 1.8 causing is not to output the console to the console log files. The only solution is to use another version of tmux.

### Upgrade Tmux 1.8 to 2.0 on Ubunutu



http://stackoverflow.com/a/25952511

Here are the steps to update Ubuntu - version 14.04 only (see below for other ubuntu versions):

    sudo apt-get update

    sudo apt-get install -y python-software-properties software-properties-common

    sudo add-apt-repository -y ppa:pi-rho/dev

    sudo apt-get update

    sudo apt-get install -y tmux=2.0-1~ppa1~t


If you have another ubuntu version you might want to install a different tmux version from the same repo. So:

ubuntu 12.04 (Precise Pangolin) step 5: `sudo apt-get install -y tmux=1.9a-1~ppa1~p `(installs tmux 1.9)

ubuntu 13.10 (Saucy Salamander) step 5: `sudo apt-get install -y tmux=1.9a-1~ppa1~s` (installs tmux 1.9)

ubuntu 14.10 (Utopic Unicorn) step 5: `sudo apt-get install -y tmux=2.0-1~ppa1~u`

ubuntu 15.04 (Vivid Vervet) step 5: `sudo apt-get install -y tmux=2.0-1~ppa1~v`


create session failed: Operation not permitted
==============================================
This issue occurs on CentOS mainly. This is caused by the standard user not having permissions to user _/dev/ptmx_.
```
create session failed: ./srcds_linux -game csgo: Operation not permitted
```

To fix this the user needs to be part of the _tty_ group.

```
usermod -G tty csgoserver
```
To check the user has been added check _/etc/group_.
```
grep tty /etc/group
```
```
tty:x:5:csgoserver
```
