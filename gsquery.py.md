## What is gsquery ?

gsquery is now included with LinuxGSM install.
It is used by the [[Monitor]] function to make sure that your server is online and answers to queries.

## How to use

Simply use the [[Monitor]] function, and if gsquery is present, it will be used.

### Known issue
The only known limit noted to this function has been seen in Garry's Mod, where the server would sometimes be frozen, but still answer to queries.
