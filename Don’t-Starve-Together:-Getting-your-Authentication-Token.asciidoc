3. Click on the "Generate Server Token" button, copy the token, and paste it into the file.

````bash
~/.klei/DoNotStarveTogether/MyDediServer/cluster_token.txt 
```

You can quickly do this by running the following command, replacing YourServerTokenHere with your server token (Keep the quotes around the token).

````bash
echo 'YourServerTokenHere' > ~/.klei/DoNotStarveTogether/MyDediServer/cluster_token.txt
```
