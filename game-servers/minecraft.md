# Minecraft \(Java Edition\)

## To-DO

## Release Settings

Minecraft java edition splits up its release in two ways. Firstly a release, this is either classed as a _release_ or a _snapshot._ Then the version number such as _1.16._ With LinuxGSM you can set these settings yourself if you want to use snapshots or a specific version of Minecraft. By default, LinuxGSM will use the latest stable release.
