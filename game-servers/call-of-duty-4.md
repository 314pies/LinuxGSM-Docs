## CoD4x

`cod4server` uses CoD4x project for its server, rather than the original, as it fixes various bugs and adds a few features over the vanilla server.

## Getting Hold of Server Files

Many tutorials state that the game disk is required to install a CoD4 server. This is because the server is built in to the client. This made it difficult to distribute and create a CoD4 server.

After investigating this issue is was found that it is possible to run a server with most of the client files removed. This greatly reduces the file size and prevents the client from being used. Because of this LinuxGSM provides a download to only the files required to run the server. Preventing the use of the client and the opportunity to use the server to pirate the game.

## Updating CoD4x

CoD4x has its own update functionality. It will automatically check for updates and does not require LinuxGSM to check for updates.
