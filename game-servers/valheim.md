# Valheim

## Valheim Tips:

Valheim's in-game browser currently only supports up to 4920 servers, to work around this add Valhiem to your steam server favorites to directly join. When adding Valheim to the server list use the query port, which is `2457` by default. To access the steam server list, at the top left of the steam library window go View-&gt;Servers, and in the new window press "Add A Server".
