Getting Support
-----------
We want to help out server admins as best we can. However, our time is limited which is best spent on developing LGSM. Patience is also wearing thin on unhelpful posts. So please help us by providing the following information when posting to help us to resolve YOUR issue.

* Which **game server** you are running (e.g Rust/CS:GO).
* The outputted **link** of `./gameserver postdetails` command.
* Any useful **log** in /home/gameserver/log (use pastebin or equivalent).
* Your Linux **distro** and **version** (e.g Ubuntu 16.04).
* Any useful **screenshot**.
* Your basic **server hardware** (CPU/RAM/Storage/Bandwidth).
* Any **test** you have already tried.
* Any other **useful** or **relevant information** you think will help.

Reminder: Make sure that your're running the latest LGSM version with:
`./gameserver uf`

All these things will help us to solve your problem. If you will not provide this information we are unable to help you. Thank you.

Where to get Support
--------------------

There are various ways to get help and support with LGSM.

Public places are the best and only way to get help: Many people can read your issue, providing more chances of being helped, and it will also help other people facing the same issue. For that matter, admins and developers do not accept friend requests and do not answer private messages about your personal issues.

Please, consider the best place to post your issue and search the internet for a solution before posting.

Google
======
We recommend ALWAYS using Google before posting at all. There are many people who have probably already had the same issue you have or asked the same questions. Putting your issue in to Google first could save yourself and us time if resolving your issue. Leaving us more time to develop LGSM.
