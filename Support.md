# We want to help out server admins as best as we can...

However, our time is limited which is best spent on developing LGSM. Patience is also wearing thin on unhelpful posts. So please help us by providing the following information when posting to help us to resolve YOUR issue.

# Please, search before asking

# INFORMATION TO PROVIDE WHEN ASKING FOR HELP
Some details are required to help us solving your problem. If you will not provide this information we are unable to help you.  
Thank you.

## REQUIRED INFORMATION

- Your **kernel** information ( `uname -a` )
- Your versions for **glibc** ( `ldd --version` ) and **tmux** ( `tmux -v` )

_That might help_

- Any useful **log** in /home/gameserver/log (use pastebin or equivalent).

- Any **test** you have already tried.
- Any **relevant information** you think will help.

Please, consider the best place to post your issue and search the internet for a solution before posting.
