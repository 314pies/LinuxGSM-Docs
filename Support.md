Getting Support
-----------
We want to help out server admins as best we can. However, our time is limited which is best spent on developing LGSM. Patience is also wearing thin on unhelpful posts. So please help us by providing the following information when posting to help us to resolve YOUR issue.

If you are a beginner and do not know how to provide those details, tell us and we can help.

* Which **game server** you are running (e.g Rust/CS:GO).
* Your Linux **distro** and **version** (e.g Ubuntu 16.04).
* Any useful **logs** in /home/gameserver/logs (use pastebin or equivalent).
* The output of **./gameserver details** (remove passwords. Use pastebin or equivalent).
* Any useful **screenshots**.
* Your basic **server hardware** (CPU/RAM/Storage/Bandwidth).
* Any **solutions** you have already tried.
* Any other **useful** or **relevant information** you think will help.

All these things will help us to solve your problem. If you will not provide this information we are unable to help you. Thank you.

Remember to consider the best place to post your issue and search the internet for a solution before posting.

Google
======
We recommend ALWAYS using Google before posting at all. There are many people who have probably already had the same issue you have or asked the same questions. Putting your issue in to Google first could save yourself and us time if resolving your issue. Leaving us more time to develop LGSM.
