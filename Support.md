# We want to help out server admins as best as we can...

However, our time is limited which is best spent on developing LinuxGSM. Patience is also wearing thin on unhelpful posts. So please help us by providing the following information when posting to help us to resolve YOUR issue.

# Please, search before asking

### Official Documentation
LinuxGSM website and Wiki will let you know almost anything you need about LinuxGSM
