Wether you chose Discord or Steam forums, you need to help us helping you. We're not wizards in any way, we don't have a crystal ball allowing us to solve any problem instantly.

We need to know : 

* Which **game server** you are running
* Is it a **dedicated server** or a **home server**
* Your basic server **hardware** (CPU/RAM/Storage/Bandwidth)
* Your Linux **distro**
* The **output of ./gameserver details** (**remove passwords**. Use pastebin or equivalent)
* Any useful **logs/home/user/log** (**remove passwords**. Use pastebin or equivalent)
* Any useful **screenshot** if needed
* What you tried to solve the issue
* Any recent event that may be related to your issue
* Any other relevent info you think will help



# How to report a bug

* Github issues FOR BUG REPORTING ONLY https://github.com/GameServerManagers/LinuxGSM/issues

### Important note  
Before posting to Github, make sure you read our documentation and you checked that the issue comes from LGSM or at least requires us to check the code if you're posting to Github.  
We don't provide help about non-script issues on Github anymore.  

If you're smart enough to find a bug, be smart enough to provide enough information for us to fully reproduce the issue and solve it. And since we're on Github, you can also make a pull request, it'll be examined, tested and probably merged if it's a good one.
