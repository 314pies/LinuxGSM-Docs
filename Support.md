5. Any useful **log in /home/user/log** (**remove passwords**. Use pastebin or equivalent)
6. What is **your issue**

If you're a beginner and don't know how to provide those details, just tell us so that wen can help you providing it.

# How to report a bug

* Github issues FOR BUG REPORTING ONLY https://github.com/GameServerManagers/LinuxGSM/issues

### Important note  
Before posting to Github, make sure you read our documentation and you checked that the issue comes from LGSM or at least requires us to check the code if you're posting to Github.  
We don't provide help about non-script issues on Github anymore.  

If you're smart enough to find a bug, be smart enough to provide enough information for us to fully reproduce the issue and solve it. And since we're on Github, you can also make a pull request, it'll be examined, tested and probably merged if it's a good one.
