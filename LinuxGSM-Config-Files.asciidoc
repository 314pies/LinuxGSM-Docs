# New Method for Configuring LinuxGSM

With this update there is a big change in how LinuxGSM configures itself. This has be done to allow the developers easily deploy new features, better manage multiple instances and allow the auto update of `./gameserver` file (previously manual update was required).

> note: If you have a "legacy" (installed prior to 16.06.17) then you can continue to use the old method of updating LinuxGSM. However to get new features it is a good idea to do a fresh install.

LinuxGSM manages its configuration using multiple config files. It is important you understand how these config files work.

# Location
By default the config files are located in

    lgsm/config-lgsm/gameserver

# Config Files
By default there are 3 main config files

    1. _default.cfg
    2. common.cfg
    3. instance.cfg

When LinuxGSM is loading the configs they will load in the above order. First taking settings from `_default.cfg` then `common.cfg` and finally `instance.cfg`. This is not that different from an Access Control List in that settings load in order and newer settings can overwrite the previous settings. 

If a setting is in both `_default.cfg` and `common.cfg` then `common.cfg` will overwrite `_default.cfg`.

## Basic examples
### Example 1
    _default.cfg: defaultmap="de_dust2"
    common.cfg: defaultmap="cs_office"
    instance.cfg: defaultmap="de_nuke"

the server will load `de_nuke` as default map.

### Example 2
    _default.cfg: defaultmap="de_dust2"
    common.cfg: defaultmap="cs_office"
    instance-2.cfg: NOT SET

the server will load `cs_office` as default map.

### Example 3
    _default.cfg: defaultmap="de_dust2"
    common.cfg: NOT SET
    instance.cfg: NOT SET

the server will load `de_dust2` as default map.

### Example 4
    _default.cfg: defaultmap="de_dust2"
    common.cfg: NOT SET
    filename-3.cfg: defaultmap="de_nuke"

the server will load `de_nuke` as default map.

## _default.cfg
*_default.cfg* keeps a default copy of the config file with all settings. Should developers add any new settings they will be made available here, making is easy to roll out new settings.This file is updated using the `./gameserver lgsm-update` command and will be automatically overwritten if any changes are made to it, so do not edit this file.

## common.cfg
*common.cfg* stores global settings for every server instance [[Multiple-Servers]]. So if you have multiple instances that require the same setting you can place it here.

## instance.cfg
*instance.cfg (e.g csgoserver.cfg)* are the instance specific settings. These settings will only apply to the server instance you are working with, they have no affect on other instances.

You can mix and match settings to suite your needs, using _default.cfg as a baseline.
