## CoD4x

cod4server uses CoD4x project for its server rather than the original as it fixes various bugs and adds a few features over the vanilla server. LinuxGSM developers would like to thank Cod4x team for there work on improving CoD4 servers. [https://cod4x.me/](https://cod4x.me/)

## Getting hold of server files

Many tutorials state that the game disk is required to install a CoD4 server. This is because the server is built in to the client. This made it difficult to distribute and create a CoD4 server.

After investigating this issue we found that it was possible to run a server with most of the client files removed. This greatly reduces the file size and prevents the client from being used. Because of this LinuxGSM provides a download to only the files required to run the server. Preventing the use of the client and the opportunity to use the server to pirate the game.

## Updating CoD4x

CoD4x has its own update functionality. It will automatically check for updates and does not require LinuxGSM to check for updates
