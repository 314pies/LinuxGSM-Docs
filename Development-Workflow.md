So as there are more people developing and adding to LinuxGSM. I though it would be a good idea to come up with a basic workflow to make sure the code can efficiently get in to the master branch and we dont get an a muddle and I can simply review code.

My current flow chart is kind of a rough idea of what I think might work and will be used as a general guide. So I will be testing it out. Let me know your thoughts and where possible try to follow this workflow.
