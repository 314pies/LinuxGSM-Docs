3. Click on the "Generate Server Token" button, copy the token, and paste it into the file:

~/.klei/DoNotStarveTogether/MyDediServer/cluster_token.txt 

You can quickly do this by running the following command, replacing YourServerTokenHere with your server token (Keep the quotes around the token).

echo 'YourServerTokenHere' > ~/.klei/DoNotStarveTogether/MyDediServer/cluster_token.txt
