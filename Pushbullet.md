## Alerts

Alerts allow you to receive a Pushbullet message if the server is monitored down, restarted or updated (See [[Monitor]]).   That notification will include some of the logs to help you diagnose what caused the crash.

To enable them, edit your script accordingly : 


#### Pushbullet:
`pushbulletalert="on"`

`pushbullettoken="accesstoken"`
