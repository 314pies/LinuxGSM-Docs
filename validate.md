This is a command for servers downloaded via SteamCMD only.

For many reasons, servers might have some broken or missing files. This command allows you to repair or re-download missing core server files, using SteamCMD's validate function. This will reset any original server file that you might have altered, but shouldn't touch any mod or config file.

Validate can also be used when server update doesn't work as it should for some reason.

## Commands

`./gameserver validate`  
`./gameserver v`
