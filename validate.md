For many reasons, servers might have some broken or missing files. This command allows you to repair or re-download missing core server files, using SteamCMD's validate function. This will reset any original server file that you might have altered, but shouldn't touch any mod or config file.

## Commands

`./gameserver validate`  
`./gameserver v`
